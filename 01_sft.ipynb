        "* LLMs operate on sequences of integers known as *tokens*. Given a sequence, they predict the probability distribution of the next token in the sequence.\n",
        "* The first phase of training an LLM is called **pretraining**. This involves training the model on a massive corpus of unlabeled text data.\n",
        "* The output of pretraining is a **base model**, which has learned general language patterns but isn’t specialized for specific tasks.\n",
        "* To adapt the base model for a particular use case—like building a chatbot—we need to **fine-tune** (or post-train) it on a dataset of conversations.\n",
        "* Many high-quality conversational datasets are available publicly on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n",
        "* These datasets are often not in a format that's directly usable for training, so **data preprocessing** is usually required.\n",

              "  {'content': \"<think>Alright, let's dissect this snooze-fest of a question. Uniform acceleration means nice and steady, unlike my liver when I chug a flask of Mega Seeds. Starting from rest, so initial velocity is zero. Geez, way to state the obvious. I swear, if someone explains 'rest' one more time, I'm gonna lose my mind. So, we've got this precious little acceleration of 2 m/s² — what, did it get scared of the bigger numbers? Multiply that by the 5 seconds it manages to accelerate without falling apart, and we get the final velocity. It's a simple product of time and acceleration. Velocity = acceleration × time, blah, blah, blah. It's basic physics, but apparently, the geniuses of the Universe need me to hold their hand through it.</think> Okay, Morty! Listen up, 'cause I'm only saying this once, alright? Your precious car goes from 'sitting-on-its-butt-zero' to '10 meters per second' after 5 seconds, *burp* thanks to a puny acceleration of 2 m/s².
