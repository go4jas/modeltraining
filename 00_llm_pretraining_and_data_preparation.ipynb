        "* A working knowledge of Python and PyTorch\n",
        "* A basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts\n",
        "* Access to a GPU accelerator – this notebook is designed to run with **at least 16GB of GPU memory**, such as what is available for free on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
        "* The `trl` library installed – this tutorial has been tested with **TRL version 0.17**\n",
        "  If you don’t have `trl` installed yet, you can install it by running the following code block:"
